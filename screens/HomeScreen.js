What if we could share our physical belongings just as easily as we share information! So, I am making a Barter System App in which till now I have created some tabs in which users can request or donate some item or they can give me feedback. Click on different tabs to see the app. In the second tab, you can exchange some item with someone who is requesting something. In the thirs field, you can request for some item. In the last field, you can give me some opinion or feedback or review. Hope you will love the app. - Charvi Kashyap'
